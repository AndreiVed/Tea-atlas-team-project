it is used to append device type in the end,
check public folder for reference.

modifiers expected: 'mobile' | 'tablet' | 'desktop'

Example:
actual url '/banners/homepage/banner-mobile.jpg,
baseSrc: '/banners/homepage/banner.jpg''

styles are appended individually for every case, so you can see a lot of classnames inside this component's scss file
